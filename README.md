ErgoAssist is a Chrome extension designed to support remote workers' physical health. It reminds you to check your posture and take regular stretching breaks, helping to alleviate discomfort and fatigue associated with prolonged sitting.

## Features

### Posture Reminders

Every 30 minutes (customizable), ErgoAssist will remind you to check your posture. Maintaining an upright posture, with your feet flat on the floor and your screen at eye level, can significantly improve your comfort during the workday.

### Stretching Breaks

ErgoAssist provides easy-to-follow stretching routines that you can do right at your desk. Click on the "Start Stretching" button, and a new tab will open with a YouTube video guiding you through a stretch routine.

### Customizable Schedule

ErgoAssist allows you to customize the frequency of your reminders and stretch breaks to fit your work schedule.
